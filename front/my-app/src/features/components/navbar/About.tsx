    <div>At ViTal, the people make the difference, of course except for our amazing furniture!


    Behind the success are people who work day and night to provide you with the highest quality product alongside the best service. You are welcome to contact them at any time. They are here for you.
    Hutam began its business in early 1995 as an importer store for gifts and decorative objects and developed into a furniture gallery spanning the world. Today the company manufactures and imports its products from all over the world, from countries such as France, Holland, Bulgaria, Indonesia, Nepal, Morocco, China and more.
    All the furniture in ViTal is collected with love by Tal and Chavi, good friends, who travel the world in order to bring to the gallery those original items with a special character. It goes without saying that solid wood furniture is a lifetime item, one that you can pass on to your grandchildren, and that time, like wine, only does it good. Hotam's website provides home design tips, design ideas and lots of inspiration. In addition, you are welcome to come in and receive home styling advice from our interior designers - free of charge!</div>
